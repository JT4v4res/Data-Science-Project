# Data-Science-Project

The following work was carried out as an evaluation method for the Data Science discipline.

The proposal is to extract insights from a hotel sector database and propose improvements for both hotels based on exploratory analyzes and knowledge extracted from the database through the use of supervised learning models.

In the present work, we use 3 classification algorithms to make a decision on a voting criterion, that is, the decision is made based on the output indicated by 2 of the 3 classifiers, the classifiers used being: Random Forest, K Nearest Neighbors and a Feed-Forward Neural Network.

The following participated in this work: Jo√£o Tavares, Manoel Tercero, Arthur Lopes and Rodrigo Ferreira.
